        <p>The brain is divided into three parts. You basically live in your brain and it controls your body.</p>



        <ol><li><strong>Cerebellum: </strong>The cerebellum is capable of muscle balance and coordination, like walking.<br></li><li><strong>Brain stem:</strong> Basic life support. The brain stem is in charge of things like breathing, heart beats, and blood pressure that keep you alive.<br></li><li><strong>Cerebrum:</strong> Performs higher functions like understanding touch, vision and hearing, as well as speech, reasoning, emotions, learning, and fine control of movement. It is composed of the following: <ul><li><strong>Frontal lobe:</strong> The frontal lobe is capable of thinking, speaking, personality and learning.</li><li><strong>Parietal lobe: </strong>The parietal lobe decodes massages, such as touch, smell, hearing, taste, sight, direction (GPS) and movement.</li><li><strong>Occipital lobe:</strong> The occipital lobe is capable of vision, color and shapes.</li><li><strong>Temporal lobe: </strong>The temporal lobe is capable of hearing and understanding speech.</li></ul></li></ol>
