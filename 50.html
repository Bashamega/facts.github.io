        <h1>Should we live in outer space</h1><br>
        <p>Many people want to live in outer space, especially on the moon and on mars. But my opinion says it is not good to live in outer space for certain reasons. My reasons are:<br>

            We don’t know what the effect to humans in outer space is for the long term.<br>
            We don’t know how our bodies will react without oxygen.<br>
            If people gave birth in space, how will the baby learn how to crawl or run, or even have enough muscles to move and stay in shape?<br>
            We will destroy the other planets and moon, just like we did to the earth, so we have to clean our own mess first.<br>
